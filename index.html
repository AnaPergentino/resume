                Full Stack Developer | Stefanini IT Solutions | January, 2020 - July, 2021 | Brasilia, Brazil

                Projects:

                Brazilian Federal Accounting Court Textual Search Tool

                I collaborated with a team to develop a textual search tool for the Brazilian Federal Accounting Court.
                This
                tool
                allows the Court to provide official documents for public and restricted (internal) consultations.

                As a full stack developer, my responsibilities included:
                Managing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for both frontend and backend services
                using
                Jenkins.
                Using Java and Spring, I designed ETLs (Extract, Transform, Load) to efficiently transfer data from the
                SQL
                database
                to the Apache Solr or ElasticSearch textual database.
                I created microservices with REST controllers that handled query parameter combinations for querying the
                textual
                database.
                On the frontend, I used Angular across multiple versions to develop various search forms, filters,
                pagination
                features, autocomplete functionalities, and implemented formatting and styling.
                Additionally, I conducted End-to-End (E2E) tests using Protractor to ensure seamless flow navigation
                within
                the
                application.

                Outcome:
                The project's success endures, with a user access exceeding 10000 individuals daily.


                Juridical Assistant

                Developed the interface of the system that is an assisted instruction solution for opinions on legal
                proceedings
                of
                the Brazilian Federal Accounting Court.

                I was responsible for:
                Creating visual elements that would facilitate this artificial intelligence to be used by lawyers, where
                parts
                of a
                legal opinion text are suggested based on the main document uploaded.
                I created expansion pannels, animations, editable fields inside a text, role permissions visibility, and
                the
                service
                calls, besides formatting and styling.

                Outcome:
                Internally developed and successfully embraced, the project has garnered a user base ranging from
                approximately
                100
                to 1000 users.


                Internships - Frontend Development

                Brazilian Federal Accounting Court | July, 2018 - December, 2019 | Brasilia, Brazil

                Using Angular, developed the interface of 3 different systems that help in the registration of official
                documents of
                the Federal Accounting Court.

                Material Error
                Developed the application interface in Typescript using Angular 5, for this system that recognized
                errors
                inside
                an
                official document when uploaded.
